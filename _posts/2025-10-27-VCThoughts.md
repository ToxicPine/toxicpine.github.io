If you're a founder, you want to raise from an American VC, and you've not settled on an idea, this blog might be helpful to you.

You should take my advice with a pinch of salt, I've not raised a large round yet.

**THIS IS A DRAFT.**

## What VCs Care About

VCs will offer funds if their investment committee believes:

* with a small non-zero probability, the valuation of my company will exceed $1b;  
* the business is far more likely to succeed, exceeding the target valuation, if they are well-funded;  
* funding the business won’t undermine the quality of the VCs portfolio in future (ie, by causing reputational damage to the VC, by undermining the balance of risk within their portfolio).

**Explanation:** VCs are better off if the valuation of the companies in their portfolio increases, even if none of them generate revenue. Ideally, the business should generate significant revenue within five years, or get acquired at a massive valuation.

### The Minimum You Need To Convince Them

VCs are run by humans. They’re tired and busy.   
They're unlikely to research your ideas, don't assume they'll know what you don't tell them.  

They’ve fine-tuned their own process for interpreting the facts about your business.   
It allows them to make sane decisions quickly and more easily justify those decisions to their superiors.  
I call this their "commercial instinct”.

VCs have two types of commercial instinct: sensing and intuiting. 

VCs can see traction, revenue, and public hype.   
I call this “Sensing”. It relies on immediate feedback signals.  
It’s a non-speculative approach to making an investment decision, but it appears speculative to outsiders.

VCs can see strategy, positioning, and resource-density.   
I call this “Intuiting”. It relies more heavily on narrative, it requires the VC to foresee a possible future.  
It’s a speculative approach to making an investment decision, but it appears methodical to outsiders.

VCs will often be rewarded for following their sensing instincts, as it relies less heavily on their ability to predict the future, rather it expects the future progress to resemble present growth. 

It’s more likely for a founder to receive great investment terms if they can appeal to both kinds of instinct.  
Founders must appeal to one kind of instinct at minimum.

Here are some Sensing VC motivations, all of the below must apply to convince a VC:

* Evidence that the business has experienced massive growth in their user base;  
* Evidence that the business has won-over credible outsiders;  
* Evidence that the business has won-over mindshare;  
  * The business’s brand is widely associated with the issue that the business solves.  
  * There are no other brands widely associated with the issue that the business solves.  
* Evidence that the founder is credible and can win.

Here are some Intuitive VC motivations, all of the below must apply to convince a VC:

* Reason to believe that the business could shift their focus towards much larger revenue-generating opportunities without significant re-structuring, change of brand, or change of personnel;  
  * **Explanation:** VCs know that they can’t accurately predict whether the current plan for the business would lead to future success, so they ask themselves “would it be rational to bet that the business could achieve profitability, based on what I know about the founder and their north star, if they didn’t have any short-term plans at all?”  
  * I’m highlighting the degree of fit between the founder and their north-star, whether the north-star has enough breadth to cover multiple possible products, and whether that north-star is believable. I’m not trying to highlight overall founder competence.  
  * VCs will consider whether the business is operating in a booming market, if the business has positioned itself uniquely relative to other firms, whether the core thesis of the business is flexible enough that they could re-define themselves, whether it would be rational to bet on the team’s ability to create profitable products if the current plan did not exist, etc.  
* Reason to believe that the business’s ability to remain competitive will compound, ie, the progress the business makes each month will enable it to execute on more significant opportunities in the next period, and (ideally) every achievement continues to pay-off indefinitely;  
  * **Explanation:** VCs expect the business to create more revenue if they can: 1\) develop a monopoly over their product segment, and 2\) expand the range of products and services they offer without losing focus. I’ve mentioned this idea of a “compounding edge”, as it is the variable that drives both monopoly power and horizontal expansion. VCs must ask themselves “does the business idea, and the market the business will operate in, make it easier for the founder to gain and maintain monopoly power?”  
  * Ideally, every customer relationship, hard-won employee, customer insight, technical development, long-term contact, etc, should meaningfully enhance the company’s ability to succeed, even as the business switches its focus onto bigger opportunities with different requirements.  
* Reason to believe that the founders are better equipped to make decisions for this business than anyone else, for tangible reasons. IE, they know something that is crucial for the business to succeed whilst other people don’t, they’ve got an abundance of topic-relevant experience, etc.   
  * **Explanation:** If not, why hasn’t somebody done this business already? Even if the VC believes that the business idea is an unexploited arbitrage, they should be able to explain why the founders were able to identify this idea earlier than others. If such an explanation exists, the founder has already demonstrated their superior capacity for decision making. Ideally, the founder has chosen their strategy carefully, on the basis of experience that other people don’t have, and this should benefit the business over a long stretch.

Here are the other, strictly necessary, criteria:

* Reason to believe that the business will significantly benefit from raising a large round of funding;  
* Reason to believe that investing in the business won’t upset the risk profile of their portfolio;  
* Reason to believe that the business will be sought-after by other VCs in the near future.

I’ve opted to not mention any idea-specific factors, VCs don’t have time to properly assess the merit of business plans and assume that the founders will pivot. Many VCs ask founders to propose a concrete business plan and demonstrate traction, but this is usually performative. VCs often offer tens of millions in funding to start-ups that are pre-product, the ask for traction can often be bypassed if these four points are met.

### Great-To-Have

* Evidence of revenue-generating activities within the company;  
* Evidence that the founder has created significant revenue before;  
* Evidence that the founder has positive relationships with other VCs;  
* Evidence that the founder can capture public attention;  
* Evidence that the founder has rare access to business-relevant resources;  
  * access to good hireables, technical knowledge, relationships, etc.  
* Evidence that the business is sought-after by other VCs.

You must embody at least two of these.

## Positive Indicators, From A Founder’s Perspective

Founders seek to generate revenue.  
Founders seek to get VC funding.  
Founders don’t believe that VCs are rational.

The lifecycle of a business may be summarized as:

* Start-up, has minimal revenue and minimal resources yet provides a good or service;  
* Early firm, has some revenue and a lot of growth-critical resources;  
* Mature firm, has mostly expended its growth-critical resources, has revenue;

Any early firm will have “intuitive” appeal; those factors influence the revenue ceiling for that firm.  
Some start-ups lack an “intuitive” appeal, but succeed for enough time to develop it.  
It’s very rare for a start-up to have strong intuitive appeal, unless its founders have world-class skill.

Founders care about the following, independent of VC incentives.

* It’s very likely for business in their market to make lots of revenue, if their beliefs are true;  
  * Founders, being rational, know that they’ll probably need to pivot. If their immediate plans fail, forcing a pivot, it would be better for them if they didn’t need to leave the market to do so, as they could retain some of their progress and most of their insight into the customer. Thus, it’s important for the founder to believe that a massive company will exist in their market, regardless of whether the first product they considered selling is worth making.  
* Their core beliefs, which informs how they act in the market, are contrarian;  
  * It is better for a founder if their competition is prone to making predictable mistakes, even if they have knowledge of the product and have enough resources to compete. It’s possible for a founder to guarantee this by selecting an idea that would fail if the obvious strategy were followed, and opt for a controversial strategy that they’re confident will work.  
* Other founders, with similar strategy and resources, haven’t failed within the target market;  
  * It’s better to learn from the mistakes of others, it will help a founder avoid areas where they’re unlikely to make revenue.  
* They have a clear path-of-action, driven by short-run KPIs which are directly relevant to the long-run plan;  
  * If an immediate plan of action can’t be formed, there’s no point.  
* EITHER Other founders don’t have the knowledge, expertise or resources needed to identify then achieve the core premise, whereas our founder does OR Other founders will fail if they attempt a similar business at a later time, if our founder captures the market early OR Other competent founders are biased against starting such a business for personal reasons (it’s boring) or social reasons (it’s controvertial), whereas our founder isn’t;  
* EITHER There isn’t a shelling point (popular meeting-point for relevant technical talent or business-relevant community) for the core theme of the business OR It’s viable to publicly counter-position relative to the entity that already has the attention of potential customers and hireables;  
  * It is better for a founder to have access to difficult-to-find talent and recent insight, otherwise it would be too easy for a potential competitor to mimic the founder’s strategy or compromise their social-technological moat.  
* If the founder continues to participate in the industry where they started their company, they would enjoy an increasing rate of return on their time over at least five years, in terms of: their own industry-relevant professional experience, their ability to hire within the industry, and the industry-relevant value of their social network.  
  * It might take ten years to exit a start-up, possibly longer. It would be ideal for a founder if  they enjoyed increasing rewards over time for continuing to specialize in their chosen industry, otherwise they might feel that their ambition has regressed or that their potential to earn has reached its limit.

Founders care about the following, partially to optimize for VC appeal.

* Their business will do things that attract public excitement, in the short-term.  
* They can, in the short-term, take actions that will make the company look more likely to generate revenue, from the perspective of a VC.  
  * VCs don’t buy into existing traction, they buy into future traction.   
  * VCs like existing traction, because it makes promises of future traction credible.  
  * There are other kinds of actions that can foster confidence in the revenue potential of a company, such as public technical achievement and

## Assessing Whether Short-Run Traction Is Possible

The Hope: “Person X has Problem Y; I’ll sell Solution Z that solves Y to X.”

1. Person X has Problem Y.  
   1. Y conflicts with X’s primary motivations, not their secondary (weaker) motivations.  
      1. For B2B: X will be promoted, avoid being fired, mitigate personal disaster, etc, if they address Y; it would be impractical for X to keep their job without adopting a solution to Y, if such a solution were to exist.  
      2. For B2C: it’s hard to say, you must judge based on X’s willingness to pay for a solution; if X can’t readily quantify how much they’re willing to pay for a solution, the problem doesn’t present a significant threat to X’s core needs.  
   2. X’s return-on-time of identifying and purchasing the solution to Y justifies their effort, ie, they’re not preoccupied with higher-urgency problems.  
   3. X can adequately assess the severity of Y, X displays a rational attitude towards Y.  
   4. Assuming that X has made every attempt to dampen Y’s impact themselves, the issue is still urgent and all of these statements remain true.  
2. Product Z can fix Y.   
   1. If X were to buy Z, it would eliminate the practical and emotional consequences of the problem, without leaving behind any concern that X couldn’t adequately address.  
   2. X could clear barriers to Z’s adoption, enlisting external support if necessary.  
   3. X will choose to clear any barriers to Z’s adoption, of their own volition, if offered Z.  
3. I can sell Solution Z to X.  
   1. X will trust me.  
   2. I’m willing to sell Z at a price that X can afford.  
   3. EITHER X can pay me OR X can force a surrogate (ie, their boss) to pay me.  
   4. I can create and distribute Z.  
   5. I can identify, contact, and engage with X.  
   6. X won’t prefer a different solution.  
   7. X won’t prefer a different seller.
