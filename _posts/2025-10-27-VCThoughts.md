If you're a founder, you want to raise from an American VC, and you've not settled on an idea, this blog might be helpful to you.

If you're a founder who wants to raise capital from a U.S. VC and you haven't settled on an idea, this post might help.

Take my advice with a pinch of salt; I haven't raised a large round yet.

**THIS IS A DRAFT.**

## What VCs Care About

VCs will invest if their investment committee believes:

* With a small but non-zero probability, your company's valuation will exceed $1B;  
* Your business is far more likely to succeed if it's well funded;  
* Funding your business won't interfere with their other investments or damage their reputation.

I've not listed revenue or profit. VCs care about these only insofar as they predict high-valuation exits or future fundraising rounds.

VCs are happiest if your business IPOs or gets acquired for a massive sum. 

VCs may profit when their portfolio companies raise another round at a higher valuation: the VC's equity stake becomes worth more on paper, and they can cash out by selling their shares.

The expected exit value should drive your company's valuation at each funding round. However, if a VC is confident that you'll raise again (from other VCs) at a much greater valuation, they'll offer favourable terms.

### The Minimum Requirements For Getting Funded

VCs are run by humans. They're tired and busy.   
They won't research what you don't tell them.  
It's not their job to find out whether your idea is brilliant or terrible.

They've fine-tuned their process for judging businesses. 
They've optimized for making sound decisions quickly and justifying those decisions to their superiors.  
I call this process their "commercial instinct."

VCs have two types of commercial instinct: sensing and intuiting. 

Sensing VCs look at traction, revenue, and public hype. They judge according to what's already happening.
To founders, this looks wildly speculative: the VC anticipates future success from a short, possibly misleading, track record.

Intuiting VCs look at strategy, positioning, and resource density. They rely on narrative and have to foresee a possible future.
To founders, this looks methodical: the VC is doing deep analysis and asking all the right questions.

VCs often favor their sensing instincts, that doesn't require them to predict the future.

Appeal to both instincts for the best terms.  
Appeal to at least one to get funded.

#### Sense-based Motivations

* Evidence that the business has experienced growth in its user base;  
* Evidence that the business has won over credible outsiders;  
* Evidence that the business has won mindshare;  
  * Your business’s brand is widely associated with the issue that your business solves.  
  * There are no other brands widely associated with the issue that your business solves.  
* Evidence that the founder is good at making money.

#### Intuitive Motivations

* Reason to believe that the business could shift its focus toward much larger revenue-generating opportunities without significant restructuring, a change of brand, or a change of personnel;  
  * **Explanation:** VCs know that they can’t accurately predict whether the current plan for the business would lead to future success, so they ask themselves, "Would it be rational to bet that the business could achieve profitability, based on what I know about the founder and their north star, if they didn’t have any short-term plans at all?"  
  * I’m highlighting the degree of fit between the founder and their north star, whether the north star has enough breadth to cover multiple possible products, and whether that north star is believable. I’m not trying to highlight overall founder competence.  
  * VCs will consider whether the business is operating in a booming market, if the business has positioned itself uniquely relative to other firms, whether the core thesis of the business is flexible enough that they could redefine themselves, whether it would be rational to bet on the team’s ability to create profitable products if the current plan did not exist, etc.  
* Reason to believe that the business’s ability to remain competitive will compound, i.e., the progress the business makes each month will enable it to execute on more significant opportunities in the next period, and (ideally) every achievement continues to pay off indefinitely;  
  * **Explanation:** VCs expect the business to create more revenue if they can: 1\) develop a monopoly over their product segment, and 2\) expand the range of products and services they offer without losing focus. I’ve mentioned this idea of a “compounding edge”, as it is the variable that drives both monopoly power and horizontal expansion. VCs must ask themselves “does the business idea, and the market the business will operate in, make it easier for the founder to gain and maintain monopoly power?”  
  * Ideally, every customer relationship, hard-won employee, customer insight, technical development, long-term contact, etc, should meaningfully enhance the company’s ability to succeed, even as the business switches its focus onto bigger opportunities with different requirements.  
* Reason to believe that the founders are better equipped to make decisions for this business than anyone else, for tangible reasons; i.e., they know something that is crucial for the business to succeed while other people don’t, and they have an abundance of topic-relevant experience, etc.   
  * **Explanation:** If not, why hasn’t somebody done this business already? Even if the VC believes that the business idea is an unexploited arbitrage, they should be able to explain why the founders were able to identify this idea earlier than others. If such an explanation exists, the founder has already demonstrated their superior capacity for decision making. Ideally, the founder has chosen their strategy carefully, on the basis of experience that other people don’t have, and this should benefit the business over a long stretch.

#### Other Motivations

* Reason to believe that the business will significantly benefit from raising a large round of funding;  
* Reason to believe that investing in the business won’t upset the risk profile of their portfolio;  
* Reason to believe that the business will be sought-after by other VCs in the near future.

I’ve opted not to mention idea-specific factors. Many VCs ask founders to propose a concrete business plan and demonstrate traction, but this is usually performative. VCs often offer tens of millions in funding to startups that are pre-product; traction is not strictly required.

### Additional Advantages

* Evidence of revenue-generating activities within the company;  
* Evidence that the founder has created significant revenue before;  
* Evidence that the founder has positive relationships with other VCs;  
* Evidence that the founder can capture public attention;  
* Evidence that the founder has rare access to business-relevant resources;  
  * access to good potential hires, technical knowledge, relationships, etc.  
* Evidence that the business is sought-after by other VCs.

You must embody at least two of these.

## What Founders Care About

Founders seek to generate revenue.  
Founders seek to get VC funding.  
Founders don’t expect VCs to act rationally.

The lifecycle of a business may be summarized as:

* Startup: minimal revenue and minimal resources, yet provides a good or service;  
* Early Firm: some revenue and significant growth-critical resources;  
* Mature Firm: has mostly expended its growth-critical resources and generates revenue;

Most startups don't have a strong strategy, positioning, and resources.
They grind to revenue first, then build better strategy and collect resources later.

Founders care about the following, independent of VC incentives.

* It’s very likely that businesses in their market can generate substantial revenue if the founder’s core beliefs are true;  
  * Founders, being rational, know that they’ll probably need to pivot. If their immediate plans fail, forcing a pivot, it would be better for them if they didn’t need to leave the market to do so, as they could retain some of their progress and most of their insight into the customer. Thus, it’s important for the founder to believe that a massive company will exist in their market, regardless of whether the first product they considered selling is worth making.  
* Their core beliefs, which inform how they act in the market, are contrarian;  
  * It is better for a founder if their competition is prone to making predictable mistakes, even if they have knowledge of the product and have enough resources to compete. It’s possible for a founder to guarantee this by selecting an idea that would fail if the obvious strategy were followed, and opt for a controversial strategy that they’re confident will work.  
* Other founders, with similar strategy and resources, haven’t failed within the target market;  
  * It’s better to learn from the mistakes of others, it will help a founder avoid areas where they’re unlikely to make revenue.  
* They have a clear plan of action, driven by short-term KPIs that are directly relevant to the long-run plan;  
  * If an immediate plan of action can’t be formed, there’s no point.  
* EITHER Other founders don’t have the knowledge, expertise, or resources needed to identify and then achieve the core premise, whereas our founder does OR Other founders will fail if they attempt a similar business at a later time, if our founder captures the market early OR Other competent founders are biased against starting such a business for personal reasons (it’s boring) or social reasons (it’s controversial), whereas our founder isn’t;  
* EITHER There isn’t a Schelling point (popular meeting point for relevant technical talent or business-relevant community) for the core theme of the business OR it’s viable to publicly counter-position relative to the entity that already has the attention of potential customers and potential hires;  
  * It is better for a founder to have access to difficult-to-find talent and recent insight, otherwise it would be too easy for a potential competitor to mimic the founder’s strategy or compromise their social-technological moat.  
* If the founder continues to participate in the industry where they started their company, they would enjoy an increasing rate of return on their time over at least five years, in terms of: their own industry-relevant professional experience, their ability to hire within the industry, and the industry-relevant value of their social network.  
  * It might take ten years to exit a startup, possibly longer. It would be ideal for a founder if they enjoyed increasing rewards over time for continuing to specialize in their chosen industry; otherwise, they might feel that their ambition has regressed or that their potential to earn has reached its limit.

Founders care about the following, partially to optimize for VC appeal.

* Their business will do things that attract public excitement in the short term.  
* They can, in the short term, take actions that will make the company look more likely to generate revenue, from the perspective of a VC.  
  * VCs don’t buy into existing traction; they buy into future traction.   
  * VCs like existing traction because it makes promises of future traction credible.  
  * There are other kinds of actions that can foster confidence in the revenue potential of a company, such as public technical achievement and credible third-party validation.

## Optimising Ideas for Traction

It's clear that some founders don't need traction to raise a large round, yet most do. 

If a founder has achieved traction, their claims will sound more believable.

The Hope: "Person X has Problem Y; I'll sell Solution Z that solves Y to X."

1. Person X has Problem Y.  
   1. Y conflicts with X’s most significant motivations, rather than their secondary priorities.  
      1. For B2B: X will be promoted, avoid being fired, or mitigate personal disaster if they address Y; it would be impractical for X to keep their job without adopting a solution to Y, if such a solution existed.  
      2. For B2C: it’s hard to say; you must judge based on X’s willingness to pay for a solution; if X can’t readily quantify how much they’re willing to pay for a solution, the problem doesn’t present a significant threat to X’s core needs.  
   2. X’s return on time for identifying and purchasing the solution to Y justifies their effort, i.e., they’re not preoccupied with higher-priority problems.  
   3. X can adequately assess the severity of Y; X displays a rational attitude toward Y.  
   4. Assuming that X has made every attempt to dampen Y’s impact themselves, the issue is still urgent and all of these statements remain true.  
2. Product Z can fix Y.   
   1. If X were to buy Z, it would eliminate the practical and emotional consequences of the problem, without leaving behind any concerns that X couldn’t adequately address.  
   2. X could clear barriers to Z’s adoption, enlisting external support if necessary.  
   3. X will choose to clear any barriers to Z’s adoption, of their own volition, if offered Z.  
3. I can sell Solution Z to X.  
   1. X will trust me.  
   2. I’m willing to sell Z at a price that X can afford.  
   3. EITHER X can pay me OR X can force a surrogate (i.e., their boss) to pay me.  
   4. I can create and distribute Z.  
   5. I can identify, contact, and engage with X.  
   6. X won’t prefer a different solution.  
   7. X won’t prefer a different seller.
